          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>All my life I've lived in a small town in Silverton Oregon with my parents and sister. I always have had an interest in computers, games, and movies and have wanted to be apart of the industry in some shape or form. I graduated from my local high school in 2017 with good grades and a 2 year scholarship to the community college in Salem, after a year of that it really wasn't for me so I started thinking maybe a gap year would do me some good. During the summer I stumbled on Epicodus and after lots of discussion with my parents we all decided to move me up to Portland to see if this is something I can see myslef doing. Other than being a super nerd back at home I've also lived with type one diabetes since I was 9 years old, and in the past 10 years of my life since then I've adopted a way of life that is to make the most of everything and don't let something or someone stop you from achieving your goals. I hope to continue this journy at Epicodus and beyond because I truly find it rewarding and enjoyable to do. </p>
