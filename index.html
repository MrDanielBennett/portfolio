          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>All my life I've lived in a small town in Silverton Oregon with my parents and sister. I always have had an interest in computers, games, and movies and have wanted to be apart of the industry in some shape or form. I graduated from my local high school in 2017 with good grades and a 2 year scholarship to the community college in Salem, after a year of that it really wasn't for me so I started thinking maybe a gap year would do me some good. During the summer I stumbled on Epicodus and after lots of discussion with my parents we all decided to move me up to Portland to see if this is something I can see myslef doing. Other than being a super nerd back at home I've also lived with type one diabetes since I was 9 years old, and in the past 10 years of my life since then I've adopted a way of life that is to make the most of everything and don't let something or someone stop you from achieving your goals. I hope to continue this journy at Epicodus and beyond because I truly find it rewarding and enjoyable to do. </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Cooking</li>
              <p class="detail">I grew up around cooking which is what created my interest in it, but my favorite foods to cook have to be pasta or pizzas.</p>
              <li>Movies</li>
              <p class="detail">I've been watching movies for as long as I can rememeber and they've honestly taken over my life, some of my favorites are; <span class="movie">Jurassic Park, Inception, and Star Wars</span>. <span class="movie">Jurassic Park</span> has been such a big factor in my life I actually drive a replica <span class="movie">Jurassic Park</span> Jeep.</p>
              <li>Gaming</li>
              <p class="detail">One of my favorite pass times is to sit down with a good game and play either alone or with some friends, recently I've really been enjoying story driven games such as <span class="moive">God of War, the Last of Us, </span> and most recently <span class="movie">Spider-man</span>.</p>
              <li>Digital Design</li>
              <p class="detail">Early on in my high school career I got into photo editing using the adobe suite and eventually got myself certified in using Photoshop.</p>
              <li>Video Editing</li>
              <p class="detail">Going hand in hand with design I found myself playing around a lot with video editing software such as Adobe Premiere.</p>
              <li>Adventuring</li>
              <p class="detail">Although I enjoy all things indoors I also like to get outside and hike, kayak, and explore the outdoors, but really who wouldn't since we do live in one of the most beautiful places in the country.</p>
              <li>Writing</li>
              <p class="detail">When I was younger I really enjoyed writing fictional stories and maybe thought one day I'd become a writer, as I got older that dream faded away but the joys of writing film reviews, research papers, and other sorts of documentation has stuck with me.</p>
              <li>Dog Watching</li>
              <p class="detail">Ever since I moved out of my house I miss my dog very much so in my free time I try and keep an eye out for dogs around Portland and I'm always excited when I'm blessed with the chance to see them around the city.</p>
